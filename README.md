# OpenMCP GitOps Templates

## About this project

This repository contains kubernetes resource templates which can be used in conjunction with FluxCD or our bootstrapper cli to setup a flux based GitOps Repository to manage an OpenMCP Platform.

This repo is just containing templates. You can check out the single templates to add them to your gitops repository.

## OCM Component

This repository will create a ocm component which contains the templates. This can be used with our bootstrapper cli to setup your platform.
This helps also to transport these templates into an air-gapped environment.
